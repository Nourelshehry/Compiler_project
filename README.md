# Compiler_project

## First Task
In this project, We use **Antlr4 program** to read *if statment* which takes each block and numbering it sequentially.
Once we put an input which contains **nested if** with *True* or *False* condition as input shown :

(You can find it in: [input.java](https://github.com/Asmahan-Rashed/Compiler_project/blob/main/input.java))

**INPUT**

As Input shown, *IF* function contains another *IF* which have an *Print* function. Our Purpose is to put *\\blocknumber + "number of this block"* in each new statment, as shown in the output.


**OUTPUT**

(You can find it in:[output.java](https://github.com/Asmahan-Rashed/Compiler_project/blob/main/output.java))

**To make this scenario:**

1- We took a grammer for if statment as you can find in ([JavaParser.g4](https://github.com/Asmahan-Rashed/Compiler_project/blob/main/JavaParser.g4))
with start rule:

2- After that we generate a parse tree, to show every branch of the tree and its children :


**Parsing Tree**

3- By using *ListenerFunctions* for specefic tokens -as we need- We made a class *extends* from **Baselistener** which is:
[TestIf.java](https://github.com/Asmahan-Rashed/Compiler_project/blob/main/TestIf.java)

4- We output our output in new file which is:

***Some Tips***


In our main file:  [main.java](https://github.com/Asmahan-Rashed/Compiler_project/blob/main/main.java) We use:


1- We use **Walker** to know how to walk through the tree and point to specific position to write before or after this position:

2- We use **Rewritter** to write in specific position as we need:
